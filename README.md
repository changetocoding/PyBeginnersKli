## Lesson Plan/Course structure
The focus on this course is home work. The best way to learn coding is by practising and self-learning. The course will focus on guiding you and helping out when stuck.

*Lessons*  
1 hour weekly  
1. Will review homework from last lesson  
2. Questions/Clarifications from HW
3. Cover a new topic related to the homework
4. Set the homework.

The homework will usually consist of:
- A learning component: some reading/online videos/tutorials/exercises where you practise what was covered in the lesson in an interactive manner.
- A practical component: An exercise to put into practise what you know so far to solve a problem.
  

## Course Requirements
- Text editor: Visual studio code/ notepad ++ / sublime text. Recommend Notepad++ [link](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v7.8.6/)
- Pycharm IDE (Intergrated development enviroment): [Download the community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- Python: [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/). (Windows x86-64 executable installer if you have a windows machine, macOS 64-bit installer if you use a mac)
